The following several pages are from [Making Your First Game in Phaser](http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game).

You can download the instructions **<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/phaser_tutorial.zip" download="phaser_tutorial.zip">here</a>**.

The first step for making a site with Phaser is to create a `<canvas>` element. The canvas element is different than the normal HTML body because it allows us to create pixels in a coordinate system, instead of a document format. 

The star on the top left is an example of a sprite. We make it appear by referencing the appropriate file and telling it which coordinates to show up at.
