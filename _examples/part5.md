subtitle: Add movement

It is a bit boring if our avatar can't do anything. Let's make the thing move! 

We can add a series of images and move rapidly through them to simulate movement. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/dude.png"/>

Then, to make it so that our avatar can move around and jump on things, we can tell our program to allow the platform and avatar collide. If we didn't do that, it would treat the platforms like a background, and there would be nothing to jump on!
